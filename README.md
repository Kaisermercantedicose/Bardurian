# ıkukıro geruqo

## Alphabet

a, b, c (tʃ), d, e, f, g, ı (i), ȷ (dʒ), k, l, m, n, ñ (ɲ), o, p, q (ʃ), r (r;ʀ), s, t, u, v, w, y (j), ’ (ə)¹

¹*The ə (shwa) is put amongst the consonants whenever they aren’t pronounceable with ease, such as **qs** (ʃs) becoming **q’s** (ʃɘs).*

## Pronouns

**ȷı** = I

**qı** = thou

**sı** = (s)he/it

**ȷıkı** = we (inclusive)

**ȷıcı** = we (exclusive)

**qıkı** = ye

**sıkı** = they

## Suffixes

### Evidentiality

**-ne** = direct obviousness

**-me** = inferred supposition

**-le** = hearsay

### Tense

**-wa** = past

**-ya** = present

**-qa** = future

### Aspect

**-mı** = perfective

**-nı** = imperfective

**-ñı** = hypothetical

Pronouns are added as suffixes to indicate possession and agents (e.g.: ıkukı**ȷıcı**, “**our (exclusive)** men”; gerulewamı**sıkı**, “I heard **they** spoke”)

**-kı** = plural (e.g.: ıku**kı**, “m**e**n”)/enlargement of event (e.g.: geru**kı**mewanıȷı, “I talked **a lot**”)

**-s** = negation (e.g.: geru**s**kımewanıȷıkı, “we did**n’t** talk a lot”)

**-q** = question (e.g.: geru**q**newamısı, “**dost** thou know if they talked**?**”)

To refuse to execute an order, you must put the negation on the subject (e.g. geru - ȷı**s**!, “speak”-“**no**!” (literally “I don’t”)). When negating an asked information, the negation goes on the subject as above, or it’s possible also on the ETA (evidentiality-tense-aspect construction)(e.g.: geruqnewamısık - newamısıkı**s** “did they talk (as far as you were assisting)?” - “**no**, they did**n’t**”). This is used for formal answers. 
It’s the same to negate the evidentiality instead of the question (e.g.: geruqlewamısıkı - **les**, “do you know if they talked?” - “**I don’t know** (no one told me that)”)

### Cases

**-qo** = ergative

**-wo** = absolutive

**-ro** = genitive (of)

**-to** = dative (to)

**-yo** = superessive (on)

**-po** = instrumental (using, by)

**-so** = partitive (some)

**-do** = abessive (without)

**-fo** = causative (because of)

**-go** = locative (in, at)

**-ȷo** = directional (towards)

**-ko** = terminative (up to)

**-lo** = transitive (through)

**-co** = comitative (with)

**-vo** = comparative (than)

**-bo** = elative (out of)

**-no** = illative (into, to)

**-ño** = essive (like)

**-mo** = sublative (under)

ıkukıro geruqo is an **ergative-absolutive** language (meaning that the subject of an intransitive sentence is treated as an object in a transitive sentence), with the difference that the subject of a passive or non-volitional verb (e.g.: gerunewamı qı**qo**, “I saw you **being forced to** speak”) is marked as the object of a transitive sentence (that is using the ergative case for the object and the absolutive for the subject). The reflexive or  action requires both the cases (e.g.: gerukımenı sı**woqo**, “I guess he will talk a lot **about himself**”).
